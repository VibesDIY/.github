# Vibes DIY

**You can code. You don’t need permission.**

Welcome to the GitHub for [Vibes DIY](https://vibes.diy) —  
a playground for apps that run like zines: fast, fun, and full of feeling.

This isn’t a startup repo. It’s a flyer wall.  
Everything here is forkable. Everything here is alive.

## 🧷 What’s a Vibe?

A **Vibe** is a single-file React app, backed by [Fireproof](https://fireproof.storage) for sync, with built-in sharing and AI support.

You don’t need a backend.  
You don’t need Next.js.  
You just need a dream.

Examples:
- `make a drum machine I can play with friends`
- `turn my skincare notes into a planner`
- `track Pokémon and talk trash in the chat`
- `turn my profile photo into a cat`

## ✂️ How Vibes DIY Works

> "Instead of a full repo with folders and config, you get **one App.jsx**. It runs in your browser. It runs in your head."

- Vibes run as static SPAs, published via Cloudflare
- The database is Fireproof — local-first, Merkle-synced, no setup
- AI is built-in but not required: use it to write code or enhance the app experience
- Your **profile is a vibe** — apps you made, chat you had, remixables you spawned

No infra. No servers. Just apps you can hand to someone like a sticker.

## 🎛 Philosophy

- Anyone can have fun coding apps and sharing vibes
- Apps should be **remixable**, not locked-down
- Learn by doing, **ship without friction**
- Clean lines and glossy gradients not required

> “Apps, not startups.”  
> “No roadmap. Just the road.”  
> “Code you can rip, remix, and re-send.”
